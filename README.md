### This is a work in progress

## Installation

- install
- install for sbot development

## Development

- linting/typing
- running tests

### Releases

- tags
- release script (run by CI)

## How it works

- sbot interface
- vision
- world design
    - base arena
    - markers

## Project Structure

- separate test world
- main world project under simulator folder
- simplified project output for releases
