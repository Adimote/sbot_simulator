This script is used to package the project to be run by end users.

This strips down the project to the essentials, removing any unnecessary files
and folders, and zips the project for distribution.

The included files are:
- The simulator directory
- A generated VERSION file
- A readme.txt copied from the user readme
- A set of zone_X folders
- An example code file in zone_0
- A setup script to install the project into a virtual environment
